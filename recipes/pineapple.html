        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Scalloped Pineapple Soufflé is a harmonious blend of sweet pineapple, creamy texture, and delicate soufflé airiness. With each spoonful, you're greeted by the vibrant tropical flavor of crushed pineapple, which infuses every bite with a refreshing sweetness. The soufflé's texture is ethereal and light, thanks to the incorporation of whipped egg whites, which lend a fluffy consistency that practically melts in your mouth.</p>
